# Cash Drawer Management Implementation

## âœ… Completed

### Database Schema

-   [x] `cash_drawer_sessions` table - Tracks cash drawer sessions
-   [x] `cash_drawer_transactions` table - Records all cash transactions
-   [x] Both migrations properly set up with foreign keys and indexes

### Models & Enums

-   [x] `CashDrawerSession` model with relationships and business logic
-   [x] `CashDrawerTransaction` model
-   [x] `CashDrawerStatus` enum (Open/Closed)
-   [x] `CashTransactionType` enum (Opening/Sale/CashIn/CashOut/Closing)

### Factories

-   [x] `CashDrawerSessionFactory` with open() and closed() states
-   [x] `CashDrawerTransactionFactory` with sale(), cashIn(), cashOut(), opening(), closing() states

### Routes & Navigation

-   [x] `/cash-drawer` - Index page showing all sessions
-   [x] `/cash-drawer/open` - Open new drawer session
-   [x] `/cash-drawer/close` - Close active session with reconciliation
-   [x] Sidebar navigation added with "Cash Drawer" link
-   [x] Authorization policies implemented

### Components

#### Index Component (`CashDrawer/Index`)

-   [x] Lists all cash drawer sessions with pagination
-   [x] Shows active session prominently with live balance updates
-   [x] Displays opening balance, cash sales, expected balance
-   [x] Shows discrepancies for closed sessions
-   [x] Search functionality for filtering sessions
-   [x] Empty state when no sessions exist
-   [x] Conditional "Open" or "Close" button based on session status

#### OpenDrawer Component (`CashDrawer/OpenDrawer`)

-   [x] Form to enter opening balance
-   [x] Optional opening notes field
-   [x] Validates opening balance (required, numeric, min:0)
-   [x] Creates new session with "Open" status
-   [x] Records opening transaction automatically
-   [x] Prevents opening when another session is already open
-   [x] Beautiful form with Flux UI components

#### CloseDrawer Component (`CashDrawer/CloseDrawer`)

-   [x] Displays session summary (opening, sales, cash in/out)
-   [x] Shows calculated expected balance
-   [x] Form to enter actual cash count
-   [x] Real-time discrepancy calculation and display
-   [x] Optional closing notes for discrepancies
-   [x] Visual alerts for overages/shortages
-   [x] Pre-fills actual balance with expected balance
-   [x] Records closing transaction
-   [x] Updates session with all final values

### Authorization (`CashDrawerSessionPolicy`)

-   [x] `viewAny()` - All authenticated users can view sessions
-   [x] `view()` - All authenticated users can view individual sessions
-   [x] `open()` - Can only open if no active session exists
-   [x] `close()` - Can only close if session is open
-   [x] `create()` - Delegates to open() method
-   [x] `update()` - Can only update if session is open
-   [x] `delete()` - Always returns false (no deletion allowed)

### Testing (34 tests, all passing âœ…)

#### CashDrawerIndexTest (11 tests)

-   [x] User can view cash drawer index page
-   [x] Shows open button when no active session
-   [x] Shows close button when session is active
-   [x] Displays active session details
-   [x] Shows empty state when no sessions exist
-   [x] Lists all sessions
-   [x] Search filters sessions by user name
-   [x] Displays discrepancy for closed sessions
-   [x] Pagination works correctly
-   [x] Active session shows expected balance
-   [x] Closed session shows all balance details

#### OpenDrawerTest (10 tests)

-   [x] User can view open drawer page when no active session
-   [x] User cannot view open drawer page when session already open
-   [x] User can open cash drawer with valid data
-   [x] Opening transaction is created when drawer is opened
-   [x] Opening balance is required
-   [x] Opening balance must be numeric
-   [x] Opening balance cannot be negative
-   [x] Opening notes are optional
-   [x] Cannot open drawer when another session is already open
-   [x] Cash drawer initializes with zero values

#### CloseDrawerTest (13 tests)

-   [x] User can view close drawer page when session is open
-   [x] User cannot view close drawer page when no active session
-   [x] User can close cash drawer with matching balance
-   [x] User can close cash drawer with overage
-   [x] User can close cash drawer with shortage
-   [x] Closing transaction is created when drawer is closed
-   [x] Actual balance is required
-   [x] Actual balance must be numeric
-   [x] Actual balance cannot be negative
-   [x] Closing notes are optional
-   [x] Expected balance is calculated correctly
-   [x] Discrepancy is calculated dynamically
-   [x] Closing notes can include discrepancy explanation

### Business Logic

-   [x] `calculateExpectedBalance()` method computes: opening + sales + cash_in - cash_out
-   [x] `isOpen()` helper method checks if status is 'open'
-   [x] Automatic transaction recording on open/close
-   [x] Real-time discrepancy calculations
-   [x] Session status management

### UI/UX Features

-   [x] Beautiful card-based design matching POS style
-   [x] Color-coded discrepancy indicators (green for overage, red for shortage)
-   [x] Active session prominently displayed at top
-   [x] Status badges with appropriate colors
-   [x] Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
-   [x] Empty states with helpful messaging
-   [x] Form validation with inline error messages
-   [x] Pre-filled forms with sensible defaults
-   [x] Dark mode support
