    -   Handles edge cases (empty data, zero values)
-   Created reusable `<x-trend-indicator />` component with:
    -   Up/down/neutral arrow indicators
    -   Percentage change display
    -   Smart color coding (green for positive, red for negative)
    -   Integrated sparkline visualization
    -   Customizable comparison labels
    -   Dark mode support
-   Enhanced Dashboard component with trend calculations:
    -   `getUrgentTicketsTrend()` - Compares urgent tickets created today vs yesterday
    -   `getUrgentTicketsSparkline()` - 7-day history of urgent ticket creation
    -   `getTodayRevenueTrend()` - Compares today's vs yesterday's revenue
    -   `getRevenueSparkline()` - 7-day revenue history
    -   `getPendingInvoicesTrend()` - Tracks new pending invoices
    -   `getPendingInvoicesSparkline()` - 7-day invoice creation history
    -   `getLowStockItemsTrend()` - Monitors changes in low stock (inverted logic)
    -   `getLowStockSparkline()` - 7-day low stock item tracking
    -   `calculateTrend()` - Universal trend calculation helper
-   Updated all dashboard metric cards to display:
    -   Current metric value (large, prominent)
    -   Trend indicator with percentage and arrow
    -   7-day sparkline chart
    -   Contextual comparison period
-   Implemented smart comparison logic:
    -   Urgent Tickets: New tickets today vs yesterday
    -   Revenue: Daily payment totals comparison
    -   Pending Invoices: New invoices today vs yesterday
    -   Low Stock: Change in items needing reorder (decrease is positive)

**Impact:**

-   Users can now see at-a-glance how metrics are trending over the past week
-   Visual sparklines provide immediate context beyond just percentages
-   Data-driven decision making with both numeric and visual trend indicators
-   Better understanding of business performance patterns over time
-   Professional dashboard appearance matching modern SaaS applications

**Files Created:**

-   `resources/views/components/sparkline.blade.php` - Lightweight SVG sparkline component
-   `resources/views/components/trend-indicator.blade.php` - Enhanced with sparkline integration
-   `tests/Feature/Feature/Livewire/DashboardTrendsTest.php`

**Files Modified:**

-   `app/Livewire/Dashboard.php` - Added sparkline data methods and render updates
-   `resources/views/livewire/dashboard.blade.php` - Integrated sparklines in all metric cards

**Technical Implementation:**

-   **Sparkline Algorithm:**
    -   Calculates SVG polyline points from data array
    -   Normalizes values to fit viewport
    -   Handles padding and scaling automatically
    -   Smooth line rendering with stroke-linecap rounded
    -   Optimized size (100x32px) for balanced card layout
    -   Block-level display prevents text overlap
-   **Layout:**
    -   Horizontal flex layout with `justify-between` for visual balance
    -   Percentage/trend stacked vertically on left
    -   Sparkline aligned to right for symmetry
    -   `items-end` alignment keeps elements bottom-aligned
    -   Maintains clean, professional appearance
    -   Optimal use of available card width
-   **Performance:**
    -   Inline SVG (no external library overhead)
    -   Minimal DOM manipulation
    -   CSS transitions for smooth animations
    -   Efficient 7-day data queries

**Edge Cases Handled:**

-   Zero previous values (shows 100% increase from nothing)
-   No change scenarios (displays "No change" neutrally)
-   Empty sparkline data (gracefully skips rendering)
-   Inverted metrics (low stock where decrease is good)
-   Missing data gracefully handled
-   Single data point sparklines (no division by zero errors)

**Test Coverage:**

-   âœ… 6 tests for trend functionality
-   âœ… All 21 dashboard tests passing (60 assertions)
-   âœ… Edge cases covered (zero values, no change, increases, decreases)
-   âœ… Color coding verified
-   âœ… Percentage calculations accurate
-   âœ… Sparkline rendering verified through visual testing
