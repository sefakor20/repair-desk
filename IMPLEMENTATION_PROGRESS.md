## üîë Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Flux UI Free Limitation Workaround**

    - Using free components where available
    - Building custom Blade components with Tailwind for Pro features
    - Maintaining consistent design language

2. **Auto-Generated Identifiers**

    - Ticket numbers: `TKT-{UNIQUE_ID}`
    - Invoice numbers: `INV-{UNIQUE_ID}`
    - Prevents collisions and maintains uniqueness

3. **Soft Delete Strategy**

    - Using `nullOnDelete` for optional relationships
    - Using `cascadeOnDelete` for required relationships
    - Preserves data integrity

4. **Role-Based Access Control**
    - Four roles: Admin, Manager, Technician, Front Desk
    - Granular permissions via Laravel policies
    - Flexible and extensible

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Technical Debt

-   None at this stage (clean foundation)

### Performance Considerations

-   Indexes added on frequently queried columns
-   Eager loading required for ticket details to avoid N+1
-   Consider caching for dashboard metrics

### Security Considerations

-   All foreign keys properly constrained
-   Role-based authorization to be implemented
-   File upload validation needed for attachments
-   Input validation via Form Requests

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

-   Multi-location support
-   Customer self-service portal
-   SMS notifications
-   Email automation
-   Advanced reporting
-   API for third-party integrations
-   Mobile apps
